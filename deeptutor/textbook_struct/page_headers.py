"""Header-driven chapter rebuild (v0.2) — running headers never lie.

MinerU discards page furniture into ``page["discarded_blocks"]``, but for K12
textbooks that furniture is gold:
  - ``footer`` blocks repeat the current chapter title (running header)
  - ``page_number`` blocks carry the PRINTED page number

A chapter starts where its running header first appears; the printed page
number comes free on the very same page. This fixes both the TOC-page false
positives of the title-block path (v0.1) and WB's 坑一 (printed↔physical
offset measured per chapter, not guessed).
