"""textbook_struct — rebuild a textbook chapter tree from MinerU layout.json.

Deterministic four-layer criteria (regex → position → adjacent-merge → TOC
cross-check), zero LLM. Spec source:
``Workbuddy-Zone/Learn/03-实施方案/P0-章节重建引擎实施方案.md`` §4.

Shared asset: consumed by the DT textbook-import path and the self-built
reader alike. Nothing in this package imports deeptutor (asset red line #1).
