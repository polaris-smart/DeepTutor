"""Assignment store for the K12 教师作业闭环 — JSON file warehouse.

教师布置 → 学生作答 → 自动判分 → 教师看统计 needs a small amount of durable
state, and per the v1 design no new database table is introduced: assignments
live in one JSON document next to ``classes.json``/``device_credentials.json``
(``data/system/auth/assignments.json``), following the same fail-open read /
atomic-write / single-process write lock conventions as the roster store.

Record shape (one entry per assignment id)::

    { assignment_id, class_id, teacher_id, title, created_at, due_at?,
      items: [{kp_id, question: {stem, options[], answer, explanation?}}],
      submissions: { student_id: {submitted_at, results: [{kp_id, q_idx,
                    answer, correct}] } } }

``items`` are a snapshot taken at assignment time from the teacher-readable
question source (``KP.meta["question_bank"]``), so later edits to the bank
never rewrite an assignment a student already sees. Submissions are keyed by
the roster username (what classes.json stores), and a resubmission replaces
the previous attempt wholesale — the store stays last-attempt-wins and
idempotent rather than growing an attempt log v1 does not use.
